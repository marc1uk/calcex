Capitalized, short (50 char) summary (sometimes automatically converted to subject for email)
(blank line is necessary)
More explanatory text if necessary. Wrap text at ~72
charaters or so (about that much). Write commit
messages in the imperative: "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug", in order to align with auto generated

Blank lines separate paragraphs

- Bullets use hyphen (or asterix) followed by space

- use a hanging indent (whatever that means)
